 Website development

Last year during the pre-fall quarter I took Strategies for Growth. As part of that class I had an assignment in which I analyzed Sensai®, an online flower shop that my cousin and my mother ran in Mexico City between 2013 and 2015. 

My analysis focused in the things Sensai® could have done better and I was so proud of my analysis that I forwarded that homework to my mother and cousin. In response, they asked me to re-open the business them with that analysis on hand. I’m the type of person who puts his money where his mouth and beliefs are, so I accept and contribute with some of the starting capital. We prepared to re-open during the fall quarter and in January of this year we re-start Sensai® operations.  

Some of the improvements that I pointed out in my analysis were related with the business website, so that’s why I decided to take the Intro to Software Development class and submit Sensai’s website as part of the class projects. I want to implement in Sensai’s operations as many as possible useful tools we review in the class.
